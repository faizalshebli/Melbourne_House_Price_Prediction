PROBLEM STATEMENT

The housing dataset given had too many variables, or even to print out nicely. And we need to evaluate all the features in the data set so that we can understand the data given to us for this project.

Step 1: Performe the EDA and understand the columns features in this data frame

I performed a complete exploratory data analysis (EDA) process by analyzing the list of columns in the data set. From here we will understand the target colums that we are going to select for the prediction modelling later on.

Step 2 Identify and manage missing values

The missing values NA has been identified and being removed from the data frame.

Step 3 The modelling starts here

The prediction target is called Y. 

y = melbourne_data.Price

Step 4 Choosing the features

We need to select the right features to determine the home price. These are the selected column features for this purpose.

Step 5 Building the model

Applying Decision Tree model and fitting it with the selected features and target variables.
